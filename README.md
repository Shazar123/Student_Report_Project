# Student_Report_Project
Analyzed a Portuguese secondary school student dataset (649 records, 33 features) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict academic performance. Key findings highlight the influence of parental education, study time, and social factors on final grades.
